## Data types

- Signed variant: **-(2<sup>n-1</sup>) to (2<sup>n-1</sup> - 1)** (inclusive)
- Unsigned variant: **0 to (2<sup>n</sup>-1)**

### A floating-point is formatted by

- base aka radix, b, either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;
- a precision p;

- Single precision (binary32), typically used to represent "float". A binary format that occupies 32bits (4 bytes)

- Double precision (binary64), typically used to represent "float". A binary format that occupies 64bits (8 bytes)

- float aka -> radix point can "float" anywhere to left, right or between the significand digits of the number.
